- Mongoose ques up all the commands and does them internally, 
including waiting for the connection to mongoDb to be established

- Schema is the plan and the model is the concrete "object" from the database for the schema

- Generally, you're going to have a different file for each schema

- schema.methods create methods you can use on the documents

- schema.statics create functions/methods you can use on the schema (since there is no document)

- schema.query create chainable methods that you can use in chains with your other query methods

- pre middleware receive a next as a param, that you have to call, just like in express

- post middleware receive a doc and a next and you have to call next to pass it along as well

- suppress next or throw error in pre middleware to prevent the save

- virtuals create "virtual" fields, i.e composed fields, you implement a getter for theme where you can return whatever you want

- populate will populate the ref field with the document itself (kinda like join on sql, but not really)
